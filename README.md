# tekton-install

`tekton-install` is a CLI for installing Tekton components (pipeline, triggers, and dashboard) on a Kubernetes cluster. It currently supports installing and uninstalling individual components of Tekton. By default, it will install the latest version of each component, but it also adds flags to allow users to specify specific versions to install.

There is currently no validation of whether or not certain versions of components are compatible, so please make sure to verify component versions will work with one another before installing certain version combinations. 

### Prerequisites

* `kubectl` must be installed - As of now, `tekton-install` is simply a wrapper around `kubectl` to pass arguments to `kubectl apply -f` and `kubectl delete -f` commands.
* A Kubernetes cluster version 1.15 or higher for Tekton Pipelines v0.11.0 or higher, or a Kubernetes cluster version 1.11 or higher for Tekton releases before v0.11.0.

### Shell Autocompletion

Similar to [`kubectl`'s shell autocompletion](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/#enabling-shell-autocompletion) 
approach, `tekton-install` features a `completion` command to enable autocompletion for bash and zsh.

#### Bash

For both Linux and macOS, installing [`bash-completion`](https://github.com/scop/bash-completion#installation) is required.

**Linux**

Use one of the approaches below to enable shell autocompletion for `tekton-install` on a Linux distribution.

To add the script to your `.bashrc` file:
```
echo 'source <(tekton-install completion bash)' >>~/.bashrc
```

Add the completion script to the `/etc/bash_completion.d` directory:
```
tekton-install completion bash >/etc/bash_completion.d/tekton-install
```

After completing the steps above, refresh your terminal to start using autocompletion. 

**Mac**

Add the following to your `~/.bash_profile` file:
```
export BASH_COMPLETION_COMPAT_DIR="/usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d"
[[ -r "/usr/local/etc/profile.d/bash_completion.sh" ]] && . "/usr/local/etc/profile.d/bash_completion.sh"
```

Use one of the approaches below to enable shell autocompletion for `tekton-install` on macOS.

To add the script to your `.bash_profile`:
```
echo 'source <(tekton-install completion bash)' >>~/.bash_profile
```

Add the completion script to the `/usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d` directory:
```
tekton-install completion bash >/usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/tekton-install
```

After completing the steps above, refresh your terminal to start using autocompletion. 

#### Zsh

Add the following to your `~/.zshrc` file:

```
source <(tekton-install completion zsh)
```

After completing the steps above, refresh your terminal to start using autocompletion.
